## Tip Calculator Project Overview

Built a Tip Calculator to calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including the tip.

- If the bill was $150.00, split between 5 people, with 12% tip.
- Each person should pay:
  (150.00 / 5) \* 1.12 = 33.6
- After formatting the result to 2 decimal places = 33.60
